# Unity tutorial - external models
## 1. Introduction to models
In Unity, models are files describing 3D objects. This includes their shape and appearance. Models are used to create for example characters or terrain, and are also able to create animations.

They often include textures or materials. It's common to create the models in external programs like Blender and then import them in Unity.

Unity provides the possibility to create prefabs - a model with presaved settings that can be reused for creating multiple instances of the same object.
